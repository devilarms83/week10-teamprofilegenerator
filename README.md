# Team Profile Generator

  
  
  ## Description
  
  The challenge is to build a Node.js command-line app that takes in information and generates an HTML webpage with said data. The critical component of the project is the unit tests for the code. 

  The user requests an app that will generate a webpage that displays a team's basic information with quick access to their emails and Github profiles.

  I learned that unit testing is very difficult to write and will certainly be a challenge moving forward.
